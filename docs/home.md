# Dashboard components
***
**Since the project is under rapid development some contents may be obsolete or incomplete,
but ALL contributors should try to update new features and changes here.**
***

This document describes the customizable dashboard for IoT Foundation. It's implemented in [react](https://facebook.github.io/react/) .

It includes:
* General documentation for dashboard contributors. This is the main entry point if you want to develop content for the dashboard.
* Documentation for the dashboard components (cards). Find descriptions for some basic cards which can be reused or used as templates. This section should only be used as an overview. Check the code for deeper insight.
* Documentation for common UI components.

**Stability: 0 - Deprecated**
This component is known to be problematic, and changes are planned.
Do not rely on it. Use of the feature may cause warnings. Backwards
compatibility should not be expected. 

**Stability: 1 - Experimental**  
This component was introduced recently, and may change or be removed in
future versions. Please try it out and provide feedback. If it addresses
a use-case that is important to you, tell the react-components team.  

**Stability: 2 - Unstable**   
The component is in the process of settling, but has not yet had
sufficient real-world testing to be considered stable. Backwards-
compatibility will be maintained if reasonable.  

**Stability: 3 - Stable**  
The component is a fully supported part of react-components. We will
avoid breaking backwards compatibility unless absolutely necessary.
